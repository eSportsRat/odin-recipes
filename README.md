# odin-recipes

This lesson has involved building a page for three separate recipes, each with headers, images, and lists to make them seem like authentic recipes one might find online. As part of this, I have used GIMP and InkScape to create .svg files to embed within the articles, seeing as the format is the most appropriate for scalable web images, that don't end up looking jagged as different devices view them.
