        <p>The following is a sarcastic, not even remotely worthwhile recipe that we here at Superglizzy Industries put together for your reading pleasure. This ultimate glizzy, sometimes referred to as <em>hotdogs</em>, is sure to make your hootenanny the talk of the town as each individual hotdog disappoints your guests in a spectacular and fun way. So, let's get right to it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One hotdog, cheapest option available</li>
            <li>One hotdog bun, left out to dry overnight</li>
            <li>Unusually sweet tomato ketchup</li>
            <li>Mustard, of the bland variety</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a medium pan on the stove on medium heat</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in some olive oil</li>
            <li>When ready, put your singular hotdog in the pan and let fry for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Put hotdog in bun</li>
            <li>Add ketchup and mustard to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="closing">It's as simple as that! Always remember, the most disappointing hotdog is the one you can't have!</p>
