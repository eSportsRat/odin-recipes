            <span class="caption">Man's gotta breathe, right?</span>
        </div>
        <p>It's that time again. You feel the need to inhale, but you're not quite sure how to get yourself a bit of air to breathe. In this recipe, we'll take a look at my own favourite air, the oxygenated kind.</p>
        <p>Here's what you'll be needing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A body in need of respiration</li>
            <li>Available and suitable atmosphere</li>
            <li>A desire to inhale and/or exhale</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All set? Great, follow these next steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring your body into suitable atmosphere</li>
            <li>Double-check body is ready to respirate</li>
            <li>Exhale</li>
            <li>Inhale</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="closing">That's it, you have now swapped the oxygen in your body for new, fresh oxygen from the atmosphere!</p>
