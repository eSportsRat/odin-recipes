        <h4>Do you really think this is how it works?</h4>
        <p>So, you want to create treebark for some reason. Most people would argue that you can't make treebark without first having a tree, and usually we'd agree with them, but we're here to blow smoke and tell you that you <strong>can</strong> do the impossible. How? Simple, just follow our unusable recipe! Here's what you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One bowl of cereal(your choice)</li>
            <li>1 cup of coffee</li>
            <li>A banana or apple</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you have all the ingredients, we'll get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bowl of cereal in front of you</li>
            <li>Place the cup of coffee at 10 o'clock of the bowl</li>
            <li>Put the fruit to the right of the bowl</li>
            <li>Start eating the cereal and fruit</li>
            <li>Drink coffee</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have now eaten breakfast, and your treebark should be ready. We hope you enjoyed this recipe, please remember to stage and commit!</p>
